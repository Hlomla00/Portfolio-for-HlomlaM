## Rules We Follow

- **Images only, never iframes** — certificates and project previews use `<img>` tags. Iframes were removed; don't reintroduce them.
- **Don't touch working code** — if a section or feature is working, leave its structure alone. Only change what was asked.
- **No duplicate sections** — each section exists once. Don't add a second Projects or Certifications block.
- **Fix root cause, not symptoms** — if an image doesn't load, fix the path or the file. Don't hide it with CSS.
- **JSON is the source of truth** — all content (projects, certs, reflections, hackathons) lives in `src/data/`. Components read from there.
- **Category is always an array** — `"category": ["Personal"]` not `"category": "Personal"`. Enables multi-category (see GUM).
- **imageUrl takes priority over pdfUrl** — `CertificationsSection` uses `imageUrl` first, falls back to deriving JPG path from `pdfUrl`.
- **Always build before pushing** — run `npm run build` to catch TypeScript errors before `git push`.

## Entrepreneurial Background

- Mobile Car Wash (Dec 2023) — residential suburb, zero budget, WhatsApp marketing, ran for 3 months with a partner
- CPUT Entrepreneurship Game — informed current problem-solving approach
- Documented in `CV.md` (Entrepreneurial Background section) and woven into all STAR reflections

## Known Non-Issues (do not fix)

| Item | Reason |
|---|---|
| GUM (ID: 3) has no thumbnail | Intentional — letter fallback is fine |
| Higher Certificate has no image | Intentional — fee situation; `note` field handles it |
| Tailwind `delay-[Xms]` build warnings | Cosmetic only, no effect on output |

---

## Todo / Still Needed

- [ ] Diploma in ICT: Application Development certificate (expected 2026 — not yet issued)
- [ ] Add SafeRide project documentation / README to GitHub repo
